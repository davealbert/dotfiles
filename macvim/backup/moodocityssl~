  #   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing
  #   the ssl-cert package. See
  #   /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz for more info.
  #   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the
  #   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.
  #SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
  #SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

  #   Server Certificate Chain:
  #   Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
  #   concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
  #   certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
  #   the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
  #   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
  #   certificate for convinience.
  #SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server-ca.crt

  #   Certificate Authority (CA):
  #   Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
  #   certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
  #   huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)
  #   Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks
  #         to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
  #         Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
